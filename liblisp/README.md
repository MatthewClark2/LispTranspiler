# Lisp Standard Library and Runtime

This library is designed to be used as a runtime for C code generated by the lispc Rust package. The supported LISP
dialect is roughly related to Scheme chiefly in its utilization of lambda calculus and relatively simple type structure.
As this is still a primarily infant project, the specific details pertaining to functionality and specification are
subject to change at any time. This document serves to try and keep up with such changes and provide a rough overview of
how the runtime works. Please check the README associated with the Rust project for semantic details.

When reading the code itself, you may notice some comments labelled `NOTE`. These are there to explain certain quirks
that may appear when attempting to use the library, as well as the reasoning behind leaving those quirks.

## Data Types

Rational numbers are always to be stored in their simplest form.

Symbols are to be interned upon creation. This may eliminate the need for keywords, but we'll have to see when we get 
there.

## Function Conventions

### Error Handling

In order to avoid raising and handling traps, all lisp functions should return a pointer to a lisp value. If the
function call results in an error, the NULL pointer is returned. Functions that do not return any value should return
the NIL static constant. Since the library is built under the assumption that NULL pointers are never provided,
attempts to access them will simply crash. This behavior is not ideal, but it will be dealt with in time once enough 
debugging information can be added into the program. It may be worthwhile to have a debugging intermediate function that
checks for NULL returns and gracefully terminates the program, while more optimized compilations skip this step and hard
crash on failure. 

## Other Minutiae

I need some kind of name other than just "LISP". Considering that the compiler is going to be written in Rust, I'm
thinking about a name like Steam, mostly so I can call the runtime the Steam Engine.
