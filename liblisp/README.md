# Lisp Standard Library and Runtime

This library is designed to be used as a runtime for C code generated by the lispc Rust package. The supported LISP
dialect is roughly related to Scheme chiefly in its utilization of lambda calculus and relatively simple type structure.
As this is still a primarily infant project, the specific details pertaining to functionality and specification are
subject to change at any time. This document serves to try and keep up with such changes and provide a rough overview of
how the runtime works. Please check the README associated with the Rust project for semantic details.

When reading the code itself, you may notice some comments labelled `NOTE`. These are there to explain certain quirks
that may appear when attempting to use the library, as well as the reasoning behind leaving those quirks. 

## Other Minutiae

I need some kind of name other than just "LISP". Considering that the compiler is going to be written in Rust, I'm
thinking about a name like Steam, mostly so I can call the runtime the Steam Engine.
